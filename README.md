VFD Wifi Clock - Michael Cupka

This repo contains code targeting the esp32 using esp-idf for my effort to turn an old oven VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) into a Wifi-Connected clock that displays time / weather data.

Currently, a lot of code is borrowed from esp-idf examples for Wifi / Http Requests.
